# Salary Transparency Analysis for Job Seekers and Employers 
## Key Business Impacts
1. Targeted applications: Filter by experience level, remote ratio, and location to prioritize roles matching skills; avoids lowball offers, boosting application ROI and securing 89% higher apply rates for transparent postings.​
2. Negotiation power: Compare salary distributions by job title and employment type; equips data to negotiate within bands, reducing underpayment risks and capturing location/remote premiums.​
3. Career progression insights: Visualize salary ladders by experience level and title across locations; identifies growth paths, equitable employers, and sectors with strong remote options for long-term planning.
## Approaches
1. Utilized a public Kaggle dataset to explore salary summaries by job_title, employment_type, experience_level, remote_ratio, and company_location, focusing on salary transparency for both job seekers and employers.
2. Used the columns job_title, company_location, experience_level, employment_type, and remote_ratio to compare compensation across roles, seniority levels, work arrangements, and locations.
3. Aggregated and visualized the results in Excel, building an interactive dashboard with slicers for experience_level, job_title, and company_location to enable deep, self-service analysis of salary patterns.
4. Tools that I used is Microsoft Excel (Data Cleaning, Pivot Tables, Formulas, Statistical Functions, Charts & Dashboards)
